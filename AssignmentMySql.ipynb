    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "**Ans:-** A database is a structured collection of data organized for efficient retrieval, storage, and management. It provides a mechanism for defining, creating, manipulating, and querying data. Databases are fundamental components in various software applications, serving as repositories for information that can be easily accessed, updated, and managed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Difference between SQL and NoSQL databases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Model:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - SQL: Follows a structured, tabular data model.\n",
    "        - NoSQL: Supports various data models, including document, key-value, wide-column, and graph formats.\n",
    "2. **Schema:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - SQL: Requires a predefined schema where the structure of the data (tables and columns) is defined before inserting data.\n",
    "        - NoSQL: Typically schema-less, allowing for flexibility as data can be inserted without a predefined structure.\n",
    "3. **Scaling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - SQL: Scales vertically (adding more power to a single machine).\n",
    "        - NoSQL: Scales horizontally (adding more servers to distribute the load).\n",
    "4. **Query Language:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - SQL: Uses the SQL language for defining and manipulating the data.\n",
    "        - NoSQL: Uses various query languages depending on the type of database (e.g., MongoDB uses a JSON-like query language).\n",
    "5. **Transaction Support:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - SQL: Generally supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensuring reliability.\n",
    "        - NoSQL: May sacrifice some of the ACID properties for better performance and scalability.\n",
    "6. **Use Cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "        - SQL: Best suited for applications where the data structure is well-defined and unlikely to change frequently, such as financial applications.\n",
    "        - NoSQL: Ideal for scenarios with rapidly changing data, evolving requirements, and a need for horizontal scalability, such as real-time big data applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "**Ans:-**\n",
    "**DDL (Data Definition Language):**\n",
    "DDL is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for defining and managing the structure of a database. It includes commands that allow you to define, alter, and drop database objects. DDL is focused on the schema and structure of the database rather than the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common DDL Commands:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Used to create a new database object (e.g., table, index, view).\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "         id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "         name VARCHAR(255),\n",
    "         salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "     );```\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Used to delete an existing database object (e.g., table, index, view).\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Used to modify the structure of an existing database object (e.g., add, modify, or drop columns in a table).\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "     ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(50);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Used to remove all rows from a table, effectively resetting the table to an empty state.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3. What is DML? Explain INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:-**\n",
    "**DML (Data Manipulation Language):**\n",
    "DML is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) used for manipulating and handling data stored in the database. Unlike DDL (Data Definition Language), which deals with the structure of the database, DML focuses on the data itself. DML commands include INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and SELECT.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common DML Commands:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **INSERT:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Used to insert new records (rows) into a table.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     INSERT INTO employees (id, name, salary)\n",
    "     VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **UPDATE:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     UPDATE employees\n",
    "     SET salary = 55000\n",
    "     WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **DELETE:**\n",
    "   - **Purpose:** Used to remove records from a table based on a specified condition.\n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     DELETE FROM employees\n",
    "     WHERE id = 1;\n",
    "     ```\n",

    "### Q4. What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example.\n",
    "**Ans:-**\n",
    "**DQL (Data Query Language):**\n",
    "DQL is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) responsible for querying and retrieving data from a database. The primary DQL command is SELECT, which is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SELECT Command Example:**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT column1, column2, ...\n",

    "WHERE condition;\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "**Ans:-**\n",
    "**Primary Key:**\n",
    "- A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a table.\n",
    "- It ensures that each row in a table is uniquely identified by the values in its primary key column(s).\n",
    "- Primary keys are used to enforce entity integrity and ensure data consistency.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "      student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      student_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "  );\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Foreign Key:**\n",
    "- A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table.\n",
    "- It establishes a link between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity.\n",
    "- Foreign keys help maintain consistency and relationships between tables.\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE courses (\n",
    "      course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      course_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "  );\n",
    "\n",
    "  CREATE TABLE student_enrollments (\n",
    "      enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "      student_id INT,\n",
    "      course_id INT,\n",
    "      FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id),\n",
    "      FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(course_id)\n",
