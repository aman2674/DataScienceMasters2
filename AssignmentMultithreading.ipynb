    "### Q1. What is multithreading in python? hy is it used? Name the module used to handle threads in python\n",
    "**Ans:-** Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads within a single process. A thread is a lightweight process that shares the same resources (memory space) as other threads within the same process. Multithreading is a way to achieve parallelism, allowing different parts of a program to run concurrently, potentially improving performance and responsiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Multithreading is Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallelism: Multithreading enables parallelism, allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently. This can lead to improved performance in scenarios where tasks can be executed independently.\n",
    "- Responsiveness: In graphical user interface (GUI) applications, multithreading can help maintain a responsive user interface. \n",
    "- Concurrency: Multithreading is useful in scenarios where different parts of a program need to execute concurrently, such as handling multiple network connections or performing background tasks while the main program continues to run.\n",
    "- Efficient Resource Utilization: Threads share the same memory space, which can lead to efficient utilization of resources. They are suitable for tasks that involve a lot of I/O operations, where one thread can be waiting for I/O while others continue to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the threading module is commonly used to handle threads. The threading module provides a high-level interface for creating and managing threads. It allows you to write concurrent code by creating threads and coordinating their execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 :- Why threading module used? rite the use of the following functions\n",
    "1. activeCount()\n",
    "2. currentThread()\n",
    "3. enumerate()\n",
